> [!Note] 
> As of right now this only works with individual .jar files and has no integration beyond curseforge's api

> This is something i am looking into fixing in any subsuquent updates.  


<h1><strong>How it works</strong></h1> 

**1. Searches for your already made /minecraft/mods/ folder and lets you select whichever mod you would like to update**  
*only reads .jar files*  
**2. You select which version of Minecraft you want to download at using curseforge api to gather all available versions**

**3. Select the download location to where you want all your files download to**

**4. Once you click the download button, it sends the gathered mod and version id to curseforge api where the download is requested and completed**
