# 🧱 Minecraft Mod Updater 🧱

Tired of the annoying process of updating your mods every time you switch Minecraft versions?  
**This tool automates that for you!**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- 🔍 Scans your `mods/` folder and reads all `.jar` files  
- 🎮 Lets you select the Minecraft version you want your mods to match  
- 🌐 Searches CurseForge’s API to find the best match  
- 💾 Downloads the selected version of the mod to your chosen folder  
- ✅ Enjoy your updated (or downgraded) mods – if available for the version you picked!

---

## 👇 How to Download & Use

1. 📥 Download the ZIP file  
2. 🗂️ Extract it anywhere you'd like  
3. 📁 Open the `dist/` folder  
4. ▶️ Run the `.exe` file (Windows may ask for permission – allow it)  
5. 😄 Done! The updater will guide you through the rest

## 💡 Notes

- Not all mods are available for every version of Minecraft
- This version supports **Fabric mods** (Forge support coming soon?)
